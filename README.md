# Mirando
<p>Mirando is a Movie Streaming React app.</p>

It can be potrayed as a clone to NETFLIX.

The components are styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
Amazing UI and fully protected Routes Gives an immersive experience with the ability to like and store the database of each user in Firebase Cloud Store itself.

## Authentication
### [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

- In order to authenticate with firebase you got to open a google account and go to https://firebase.google.com/ 
- Create a new Project and select the web app development. Firebase will give you a bunch of key and tokens and you are good to go
- Use the auth tokens and create protected routes and user authentication with the React Context API

## Deployment
I personally prefer vercel for deploying my projects.
Its super Easy -- 
- Connect the git repository.
- Give a unique name to the project
- Mention the root folder
- And Deploy.
